### Minimum Length Substring

Given two strings S and T, write an efficient program to find the minimum length substring in S which contains all the characters of T.
>Note: S and T does not contains spaces.
<hr>

### Input

First line contains a string S<br/>
Second line contains a string T
<hr>

### Output
Print the required substring in a single line. If there are multiple substrings with same length, print the one that occurs first (a substring with minimum start index).
<hr>

### Constraints

1 <= length of S <= 10^5<br/>
1 <= length of T <= length of S
<hr>

### Sample Input

```
a*bbcs?ddd
bcd
```
<hr>

### Sample Output
```
bcs?d
```
