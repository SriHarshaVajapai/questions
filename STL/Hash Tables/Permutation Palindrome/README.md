### Permutation Palindrome

Given a string S with only lowercase alphabets of N length, write an efficient program to find if any of the permutations of S can be a palindrome.
>Note: S does not contain spaces.
<hr>

### Input

First line contains a single integer T. T testcases follow.<br/>
The only line of a testcase contains a string S.
<hr>

### Output
Print "YES" or "NO" based on the above context for each testcase in T in a new line.
<hr>

### Explanation
If S = "SSMMLLP", we can permute S as "SMLPLMS" which is a palindrome.<br/>
IF S = "ABC", then we can not permute S in any way to make it a palindrome.

### Constraints

1 <= T <= 50<br/>
1 <= N <= 10^5
