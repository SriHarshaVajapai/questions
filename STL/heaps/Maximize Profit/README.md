### Maximize Profit

Given an array 'rows[]' of N integers where 'rows[i]' represents the
number of empty seats present in the 'ith' row. There are M people 
willing to buy tickets, each seat costs equal to the number of empty 
seats present in that row. Write an efficient program to maximize the 
profit by selling tickets to M people

### Input

First line contains two space separated integers N and M<br/>
Second line contains N space separated integers of 'rows[]'
