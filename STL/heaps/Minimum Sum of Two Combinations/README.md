### Minimum Lecture Halls

Given an array A of N length with numbers in range 0 to 9 inclusive, 
write an efficient program to find the minimum possible sum of two 
numbers formed from A[i].
>Note: All the elements in A must be used to form the two numbers. 
The input array A will have at least one zero in it if N is 40.
<hr>

### Input

First line contains a single integer T. T testcases follow.<br/>
First line of a testcase contains a single integer N<br/>
Second line of a test case contains N space separated integers of A
<hr>

### Output

For every testcase in T, print a single integer based on the above context in a new line.
<hr>

### Constraints

1 <= T <= 200<br/>
2 <= N <= 40<br/>
0 <= A[i] <= 9
